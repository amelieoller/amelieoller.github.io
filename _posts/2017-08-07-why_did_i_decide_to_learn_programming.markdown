I’ve always been into technology - I just never had the guts to go through with it. I studied International Business Management because with a business degree you can do anything, right? Well, I don’t necessarily regret it; it did give me many skills that I wouldn’t want to miss, but I always secretly wanted to be in technology. From college, I went on to work in online marketing (a little bit more related to technology while still being in the field I was studying - my major was marketing). Also, Berlin was a good place to find good internships in marketing.
From Online Marketing I went on to build WordPress sites - definitely more technology-related but still not full-blown programming. 

Here I am, now, finally following my dream, and studying to become a programmer full-time. My previous years dabbling with the command line, learning bits of Git and doing HTML and CSS, have definitely made things easier for me. Right now I just feel like I’m putting all the knowledge together that I have sporadically accumulated over the years. 

Working on small arduino projects and RPIs has really helped me understand computers better and made me fall in love more with programming. What I love about programming is that you get to solve problems just with the knowledge you’ve gathered over the years and you get to build something that works well. I’ve also grown to like structuring my code well, and commenting on it so others can see and understand what I’ve done. But of course the coolest thing about programming is to feel awesome solving problems while sitting in front of monitors with a bunch of code on the screen.

Learning back- and front-end development can definitely be discouraging at times but the passion, the community and small and large accomplishments here and there have really helped me stay on track and work as hard as I can. I’m not afraid of a challenge, and whatever programming is going to throw at me, I’m ready for it.
