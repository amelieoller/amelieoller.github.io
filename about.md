Iâ€™m Amelie Oller, a Full Stack Developer, who is always looking for new challenges. I recently graduated from the Flatiron School Full Stack Developer Program. At the moment my languages of choice are Ruby (on Rails) and JavaScript (often with React & Redux). 

Programming is my one true passion, beside that I love graphic design and tinkering with electronics.

My journey has just begun and I'm looking forward to learning new languages, meeting intesting people and most of all writing great code.
