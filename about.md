Iâ€™m Amelie Oller, a Full Stack Developer who is always looking for new challenges. I recently graduated from the [Flatiron School Full Stack Web Developer Program](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-web-developer-career-course/). At the moment my languages of choice are Ruby (on Rails) and JavaScript (often with React & Redux). 

Programming is my one true passion, beside that, I love Graphic Design, tinkering with electronics (Arduino) and woodworking.

My journey has just begun and I'm looking forward to learning new languages, meeting interesting people and most of all writing great code.
