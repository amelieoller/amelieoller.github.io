> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, [many non-browser environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_Web_pages) also use it, such as [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) and [Adobe Acrobat](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html). JavaScript is a [prototype-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prototype-based_programming), multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. - [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
